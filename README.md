# City Power & Light - Site Inspection Demo App

A Power Apps Canvas app to showcase out of box features (some in Preview) of a site inspection scenario.

It supports collection of multiple types of documentation during an inspection. Once inspection is complete all assets are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as json. From here you can process as you wish, or, you can change the app to store the assets elsewhere.

Collect the following types of documentation:
* Photo
* Rich Text
* Audio
* Pen / Ink
* Mixed Reality Measurement

The app also includes an interactive map that displays the locations of the documentation collected.
